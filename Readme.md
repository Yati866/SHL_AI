# 📘 SHL RAG Assistant

**SHL RAG Assistant** is an intelligent tool designed to help users find the most relevant SHL assessments based on natural language queries. It uses **web scraping**, **semantic search** (via Sentence Transformers), and **Supabase** as a backend vector database — all wrapped in a sleek **Streamlit** frontend.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Semantic search over SHL assessments (RAG-style)
- 🧠 Embedding-based matching using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- 📊 Structured metadata: test type, duration, adaptive, remote-compatible
- 🌐 Streamlit frontend for user interaction
- ⚡ Real-time filtering and matching using Supabase vector RPC

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shl-rag-assistant.git
   cd shl-rag-assistant
   ```

2. **Install Requirements**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up `.env` File**

   Create a `.env` file in the root with:
   ```env
   SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key
   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit App**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 🧠 How It Works

- `scraper.py`: Crawls SHL's public product catalog and collects metadata like test types, duration, adaptive, etc.
- `embed_and_upload.py`: Converts each scraped test into a vector embedding using `sentence-transformers` and uploads it to Supabase (`products` table).
- `match_products` (Supabase RPC): Vector search procedure that finds semantically close results based on user input.
- `query_assessments.py`: Queries Supabase for top matches based on similarity threshold.
- `app.py`: Frontend in Streamlit allowing users to input natural queries and view the best-fit SHL assessments.

## 📊 Example Query

> _"Looking for a short adaptive personality test that works remotely."_

✅ Output will show:
- Relevant test name
- Duration
- Remote & Adaptive support
- Test type
- Direct SHL URL
- Similarity score

---

## ✅ To-Do / Improvements

- [ ] Add user authentication or analytics tracking (optional)
- [ ] Include summary generation for each assessment
